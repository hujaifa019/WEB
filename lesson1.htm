        <div class="answer-box"><strong>A:</strong> Usually when school began there was a great bustle which could be heard out in the street, the opening and closing of desks. But it was all very still that day. Everything was as quiet as Sunday morning. There was no opening or closing of desks. His classmates were already in their places. The teacher's great ruler instead of rapping on the table was under M.Hamel's arm.</div>

        <div class="question-box"><strong>Q:</strong> What had been put up on the bulletin-board?</div>
        <div class="answer-box"><strong>A:</strong> The bulletin-board notified the general public about an order from Berlin. It stated that only German was to be taught to students in the schools of Alsace and Lorraine.

        <div class="answer-box"><strong>A:</strong> The order from Berlin brought all the routine hustle-bustle of the school life to stand -still. Mr.Hamel had put on his best dress-his beautiful green coat his frilled shirt and little black silk cap,all embroidered. The whole school seemed so strange and solemn. On the back benches that were always empty but that day elderly village people were sitting quietly like the student's. The order also brought about a great change in the feelings of

the people towards their country and their native languages</div>
